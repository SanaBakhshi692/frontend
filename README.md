# To Do App

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a front-end learner focused on practicing React by building small projects. I enjoy improving my skills step by step through hands-on experience.

## ðŸ›  Skills

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me undrestand and practice the basics of React

Here are some of the key things I learned:

- How to build and organize components in React
- Using `useReducer` to manage more structured state
- Sharing data between components using `Context API`
- Saving tasks in `localStorage` so they stay after refreshing
- Handling form inputs and updating the UI in real time
- Writing simple search and filter functions

while building this Todo List, I also got more comfortable using vite and structuring small React Projects. This was a good practice to connect the things I've been learning so far.

## Features

- Delete Existing tasks
- Edit tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
